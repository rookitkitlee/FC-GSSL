## Node Classification

### Download Datasets
If not otherwise specified, the code will automatically download the required datasets during data preprocessing.

For BlogCatalog, please unzip `./dataset/blog.zip` before running the program.

For Penn94, We use the datasets provided in ["Large Scale Learning on Non-Homophilous Graphs: New Benchmarks and Strong Simple Methods"]([https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14446](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14446)). It is available on [Non-Homophily-Large-Scale](https://github.com/CUAI/Non-Homophily-Large-Scale/blob/master/data/facebook100/Penn94.mat). Download the file and put it under `./dataset`. 

For arXiv-year and Penn94, we adopt the same data splits as provided in the [Non-Homophily-Large-Scale](https://github.com/CUAI/Non-Homophily-Large-Scale/tree/master/data/splits). They have been saved in `./dataset`.

### Running
(1) To preprocess the datasets, move into `./node` or `./node_batch` and run `preprocess.py`.

(2) Train and evaluate FC-GSSL for node classification by running `train_node.py` or `train_batch.py`.

## Graph Prediction
Move into to `./ogbg` directory, then run  `preprocess.py` and `train_graph.py` for graph prediction tasks.

## Transfer Learning
### Download Datasets
For ZINC-2M, fownload from [chem data](https://snap.stanford.edu/gnn-pretrain/data/chem_dataset.zip) (2.5GB), unzip it, and put `./zinc_standard_agent` under `./dataset`.

For QM9, fownload from [MoleculeNet](https://moleculenet.org/datasets-1) and put the file `qm9.csv` under `./dataset/qm9/raw/qm9.csv`

### Running

(1) Move into `./qm9` and run `pretrain.py` to pre-train the encoder.

(2) Fine-tune the pre-trained encoder on QM9 by runing `tune_qm9.py`.
